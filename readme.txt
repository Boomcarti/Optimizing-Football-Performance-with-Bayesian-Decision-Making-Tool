Greetings
The Bayesaina Network is in the Bayesain.ipynb file and the Decsiosn Network via Infererence Diagram is in the
Decsiosn.ipynb file.

Running both will display  the networks and other relevant information.

The BN_Visuals and DN_Visuals are made in order to display the various diagrams for both networks.
These files also generate the probabilty tables for the networks 


The dataset used can be found in the events .csv file.
Thank You
